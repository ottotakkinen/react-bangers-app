## About

The website consist of a form to add songs to the list of previews. From there, the users can listen to snippets and then open the songs on Spotify to add to their playlists or collections.

In our DJ accosiation we have had this #bangerthursday thing for a while now and this website can be used in a similar fashion, to post your favourite songs for everyone to see.

## Things I learned

- CSS modules
- Embedding Spotify tracks to websites
- Using Netlify Functions with Express

## Todo

- Querying the songs in smaller batches from the API
